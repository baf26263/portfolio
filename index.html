            <p class="text-light">I am 26 years old, and I have always had a very curious interest in the tech world.
                I grew up in Chesapeake Virginia with my Mom and and step dad, along with my 4 younger siblings. 
                I went to Grassfield High School, which was the "Tech" High school, but not in the sense of trades,
                but they actually had a tech program for stuff Coding Temple does. I almost went into that rpogram, but got cold feet,
                and my interests were deeper rooted in furthering my involvement with Young Life.

            <h2>Young Life</h2>
            <p>I was involced with the non-profit organization called Young Life for about 10 years, both as a student and as a Leader.
                It was more or less an outreach ministry to help middle school and high school kids learn and understand the Gospel. 
                We did this through building long lasting relationships by building the "Right to be heard". Through weekly clubs filled 
                with laughter, skits, songs, and games, with a talk at the end that was an introductory message of the progressing gospel story.
                I truly would not be the person I am today without my Young Life leaders place in my life, and I feel at least a few of my students can say the same, I truly can only hope hope.

            <p>When I moved out of my parents house, I met a man name Ben Savory, and he at the time was an influential person in my life,
                he convinced me to move to his City here in Winchester to help build and grow a new Young Life program. It ended up breathtaking
                incredibly successful and still is thriving to this day. I was not only lucky enough to be apart of that, but I was also fortunate enough to
                meet my wife through this wonderful organization.

            <h2>My Wedding</h2>
            <p> My Wife Abby and I got married on December 29, 2018. Our love story from meeting, to dating, to marriage was a unique one really. 
                We met through Young Life, and we led together on different teams at different schools. We would randomly run into one another 
                at a local coffeee shop and progressively found ourselves doing this more and more and talking longer and longer. Ironically we
                were both "seeing" other people, but nothing serious that really became anything, obviously. Eventually we found ourselves 
                talking every day and truly enjoying one anothers company. I had a YL program I was doing for the whole Summer in Pigeon Forge, TN that summer,
                so we decided that we should get to know each other more from a distance. Well, long story short we realized that was silly, and we gave each other titles within a week. 
                Then the first 3 months of our relationship was long diatance. Rough. Fast forward 6 months, we were engaged. Fast forward another 10 weeks, and we were married.
                We knew from the start whether we consciously knew it or not. We've been happily married since and have 2 little pups that are our world.
