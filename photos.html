                                Kegan, we grew up together and discovered YL together. I truly don't know where I would be in life without him.

                                They are all off doing super awesome things with their lives whether that be school, or professional sports (right??), even YL,
                                they'll always hold a part of my heart. It's a little crazy sometimes knowing they're all grown up and some even graduating college now.

                            <p class="card-text text-center">A huge part of YL is camp, and a huge part of running a camp is staff. With YL being a non-profit,
                                volunteers are very necessary. So what they do, is split every summer into 3 "sessions", and each session, a new group of volunteers come
                                to run the camp, typically one for June, July, and August. In August 2016 my senior summer I did the High school version called Work Crew. These are just a few of the people 
                                I did it with, and are friendships I still keep up with to this day. Three of them were my groomsmen even. I miss them greatly all the time. The guy in the white long sleeve is Ben,
                                the one who convinced me to move here.
